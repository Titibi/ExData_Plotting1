The plotting code for all the four plot is in the file Plot_assignment.R.

Following vectors were created in the code:
1. hcp = a data frame containing the data
2. useful_dates = a data frame to filter out 1/1/2007 and 2/2/2007 data from hcp. The code uses grep command to extract the row
numbers of these dates and then overwrite hcp data frame.

Plots are generated in section Plot1, Plot 2, Plot 3 and Plot 4 respectively and each section generates a ".png" file.

Png files of the generated plots are also attached.
